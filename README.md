## Gallery Project


##### Working away on a new gallery site built in React and inspired by designer Nathan Riley: https://dribbble.com/shots/6154629-Gallerie-Due-Concept/attachments 

##### Layout of the site is also partially inspired by the David Zwirner Gallery website: https://www.davidzwirner.com/ as I love art and I love the David Zwirner galleries 

### Please note, I am actively working on site responsiveness! 

Enjoy :)
